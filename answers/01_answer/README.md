# 💡 Exercise 1 - Unit Tests

## 🎯 Objective
In the `StringHelper` class, we have three utility functions to test:

- **🔍 isPalindrome**: This function takes a string as input and determines if it is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, or expression that reads the same backward as forward, for example: _"radar"_.
- **🔄 isAnagram**: This function takes two strings as input and checks if they contain the same characters, for example: _"elbow"_ and _"below"_.
- **🐪 toCamelCase**: This function converts a phrase into a camelCase string. For example, _"I eat an apple"_ becomes _"IEatAnApple"_.

## ✅ Answer

- In the `StringUtilsTest` class, you will find a series of unit tests generated using Continue that cover various cases, both valid and invalid, as well as edge cases.
- You can run these tests to check their validity.

### 🚀 How to Run the Tests
Run Maven in the terminal to execute the tests:

```bash
mvn clean test
```
